# smooth-scroll-js

A lightweight JavaScript plugin that enables smooth scrolling to target sections on a webpage, without adding the target section's ID to the URL.

## Usage

1. Include the `smooth-scroll.js` script in your HTML file, e.g.:

```html
   <script src="smooth-scroll.js"></script>
```

2. Call the SmoothScroll() function to activate the smooth scrolling behavior on all links with a href attribute that starts with #, e.g.:

```js
<script>
  SmoothScroll();
</script>
```

That's it! Now your links will smoothly scroll to the target sections on your page without adding the target section's ID to the URL.
